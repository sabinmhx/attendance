# python-face-recognition
Student Attendance System using Face Recognition. Python3 and OpenCV Library used. <br>
Detection techniques uses Haar Cascade Classifiers algorithm. This is basically a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of images both positive and negative. Based on the training it is then used to detect the objects in the other images. <br>
In this use-case we will try to detect the face of individuals using the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml <br>
Package Requirements:
- opencv
- tkinter
- pandas
- numpy
- cx_Freeze
